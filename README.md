# Betway Assesment

Build an open bar tab web app in your preferred frontend framework. The web app should be as slim as possible, but cover the listed user stories.

## User Stories

- As a user I want a view that lists 3 different kinds of beverages.
- As a user I should be able to enter how many of each type of beverage I want for a “round of drinks”.
- As a user I should be able to submit/add the specified order or beverages to my open tab.
- As a user I want to, optionally, enter how many people will split the total bill.
- As a user I want to, at any time, be able to request the total of my bill - including a price per. person, if applicable.
- As a user I would like to be able to export the tab as a CSV or PDF to give to the customer as a receipt.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
